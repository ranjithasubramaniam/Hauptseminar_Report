A report on the research topic **"Depth estimation from stereo camera based on Convolutional Neural Networks"**

## Abstract:
Depth estimation from the two-dimensinal images has several applications and this 
report emphasizes the significance of accurate depth perception in the recent 
technological advancements. The report is organized with an introduction to the stereo
image pairs followed by which different terms concerning the stereo geometry are
explained. Stereo depth perception was carried out using conventional algorithms
before the Convolutional Neural Networks gained their significance. These stereo
matching algorithms could not provide efficient depth perception under specific 
scenarios. As we are in the era of assisted and autonomous driving, accurate depth
estimation for the real world scenario becomes essential. The recent popularity
of deep learning resulted in the proposal of numerous stereo depth perception 
architectures using Convolutional Neural Networks. A few recently proposed CNN
architectures for the real time depth perception of stereo images are discussed in
this report. Additionally, an evaluation of these architectures is documented by
comparing the different aspects of each network including their pros and cons.
